Pure Rust implementation of the EAX
Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) Cipher
with optional architecture-specific hardware acceleration

This scheme is only based on a block cipher. It uses counter mode (CTR) for
encryption and CBC mode for generating a OMAC/CMAC/CBCMAC (all names for the same thing).
