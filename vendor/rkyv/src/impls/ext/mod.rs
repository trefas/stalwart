// Support for various common crates. These are primarily to get users off the
// ground and build some momentum.

// These are NOT PLANNED to remain in rkyv for the final release. Much like
// serde, these implementations should be moved into their respective crates
// over time. Before adding support for another crate, please consider getting
// rkyv support in the crate instead.
