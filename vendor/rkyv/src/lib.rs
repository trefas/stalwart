//! rkyv is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! rkyv uses Rust's powerful trait system to serialize data without reflection.
//! Many zero-copy deserialization frameworks use external schemas and heavily
//! restrict the available data types. By contrast, rkyv allows all serialized
//! types to be defined in code and can serialize a wide variety of types that
//! other frameworks cannot.
//!
//! rkyv scales to highly-capable as well as highly-restricted environments. Not
//! only does rkyv support "no-std" builds for targets without a standard
//! library implementation, it also supports "no-alloc" builds for targets where
//! allocations cannot be made.
//!
//! rkyv supports limited in-place data mutation, and so can access and update
//! data without ever deserializing back to native types. When rkyv's in-place
//! mutation is too limited, rkyv also provides ergonomic and performant
//! deserialization back into native types.
//!
//! rkyv prioritizes performance, and is one of the fastest serialization
//! frameworks available. All of rkyv's features can be individually enabled and
//! disabled, so you only pay for what you use. Additionally, all of rkyv's
//! zero-copy types are designed to have little to no overhead. In most cases,
//! rkyv's types will have exactly the same performance as native types.
//!
//! See the [rkyv book] for guide-level documentation and usage examples.

//!
//! ## Components
//!
//! rkyv has [a hash map implementation] that is built for zero-copy
//! deserialization, with the same lookup and iteration performance as the
//! standard library hash maps. The hash map implementation is based on
//! [Swiss Tables] and uses a target-independent version of FxHash to ensure
//! that all targets compute the same hashes.
//!
//! It also has [a B-tree implementation] that has the same performance
//! characteristics as the standard library B-tree maps. Its compact
//! representation and localized data storage is best-suited for very large
//! amounts of data.
//!
//! rkyv supports [shared pointers] by default, and is able to serialize and
//! deserialize them without duplicating the underlying data. Shared pointers
//! which point to the same data when serialized will still point to the same
//! data when deserialized. By default, rkyv only supports non-cyclic data
//! structures.
//!
//! Alongside its [unchecked API], rkyv also provides optional [validation] so
//! you can ensure safety and data integrity at the cost of some overhead.
//! Because checking serialized data can generally be done without allocations,
//! the cost of checking and zero-copy access can be much lower than that of
//! traditional deserialization.
//!
//! rkyv is trait-oriented from top to bottom, and is made to be extended with
//! custom and specialized types. Serialization, deserialization, and
//! validation traits all accept generic context types, making it easy to add
//! new capabilities without degrading ergonomics.

//! [shared pointers]: rc
//! [unchecked API]: access_unchecked
//! [validation]: access
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! rkyv has several feature flags which can be used to modify its behavior. By
//! default, rkyv enables the `std`, `alloc`, and `bytecheck` features.
//!
//! ### Format control
//!
//! These features control how rkyv formats its serialized data. Enabling and
//! disabling these features may change rkyv's serialized format, and as such
//! can cause previously-serialized data to become unreadable. Enabling format
//! control features that are not the default should be considered a breaking
//! change to rkyv's serialized format.
//!
//! Binaries should consider explicitly choosing format control options from the
//! start, even though doing so is not required. This ensures that developers
//! stay informed about the specific choices being made, and prevents any
//! unexpected compatibility issues with libraries they depend on.
//!
//! Libraries should avoid enabling format control features unless they intend
//! to only support rkyv when those specific format control features are
//! enabled. In general, libraries should be able to support all format control
//! options if they use rkyv's exported types and aliases.
//!
//! #### Endianness
//!
//! If an endianness feature is not enabled, rkyv will use little-endian byte
//! ordering by default.
//!
//! - `little_endian`: Forces data serialization to use little-endian byte
//!   ordering. This optimizes serialized data for little-endian architectures.
//! - `big_endian`: Forces data serialization to use big-endian byte ordering.
//!   This optimizes serialized data for big-endian architectures.
//!
//! #### Alignment
//!
//! If an alignment feature is not enabled, rkyv will use aligned primitives by
//! default.
//!
//! - `aligned`: Forces data serialization to use aligned primitives. This adds
//!   alignment requirements for accessing data and prevents rkyv from working
//!   with unaligned data.
//! - `unaligned`: Forces data serialization to use unaligned primitives. This
//!   removes alignment requirements for accessing data and allows rkyv to work
//!   with unaligned data more easily.
//!
//! #### Pointer width
//!
//! If a pointer width feature is not enabled, rkyv will serialize `isize` and
//! `usize` as 32-bit integers by default.
//!
//! - `pointer_width_16`: Serializes `isize` and `usize` as 16-bit integers.
//!   This is intended to be used only for small data sizes and may not handle
//!   large amounts of data.
//! - `pointer_width_32`: Serializes `isize` and `usize` as 32-bit integers.
//!   This is a good choice for most data, and balances the storage overhead
//!   with support for large data sizes.
//! - `pointer_width_64`: Serializes `isize` and `usize` as 64-bit integers.
//!   This is intended to be used only for extremely large data sizes and may
//!   cause unnecessary data bloat for smaller amounts of data.
//!
//! ### Functionality
//!
//! These features enable more built-in functionality and provide more powerful
//! and ergonomic APIs. Enabling and disabling these features does not change
//! rkyv's serialized format.
//!
//! - `alloc`: Enables support for the `alloc` crate. Enabled by default.
//! - `std`: Enables standard library support. Enabled by default.
//! - `bytecheck`: Enables data validation through `bytecheck`. Enabled by
//!   default.
//!
//! ### Crates
//!
//! rkyv provides integrations for some common crates by default. In the future,
//! crates should depend on rkyv and provide their own integration. Enabling and
//! disabling these features does not change rkyv's serialized format.
//!
//! - [`arrayvec-0_7`](https://docs.rs/arrayvec/0.7)
//! - [`bytes-1`](https://docs.rs/bytes/1)
//! - [`hashbrown-0_14`](https://docs.rs/hashbrown/0.14)
//! - [`hashbrown-0_15`](https://docs.rs/hashbrown/0.15)
//! - [`indexmap-2`](https://docs.rs/indexmap/2)
//! - [`smallvec-1`](https://docs.rs/smallvec/1)
//! - [`smol_str-0_2`](https://docs.rs/smol_str/0.2)
//! - [`smol_str-0_3`](https://docs.rs/smol_str/0.3)
//! - [`thin-vec-0_2`](https://docs.rs/thin-vec/0.2)
//! - [`tinyvec-1`](https://docs.rs/tinyvec/1)
//! - [`triomphe-0_1`](https://docs.rs/triomphe/0.1)
//! - [`uuid-1`](https://docs.rs/uuid/1)
//!
//! ## Compatibility
//!
//! Serialized data can be accessed later as long as:
//!
//! - The underlying schema has not changed
//! - The serialized format has not been changed by format control features
//! - The data was serialized by a semver-compatible version of rkyv
