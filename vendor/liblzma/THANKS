Thanks
======

Some people have helped more, some less, but nevertheless everyone's help
has been important. :-) In alphabetical order:
  - Ayush Singh
  - Ivan Krivosheev
  - Luke Street

Also thanks to all the people who have participated in the liblzma-rs project.

I have probably forgot to add some names to the above list. Sorry about
that and thanks for your help.
