`tryhard` makes it easy to retry futures that might fail. You can control the number of retries, the backoff strategy, and the max duration.

## Examples

First imagine you have some async function that can fail:

```rust
async fn read_file(path: &str) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
    // ...
}
```

Calling that function and retrying at most 10 times with no delay between attempts can be done like so:

```rust
tryhard::retry_fn(|| read_file("Cargo.toml"))
    .retries(10)
    .await?;
```

You can also retry with a fixed delay between attempts:

```rust
tryhard::retry_fn(|| read_file("Cargo.toml"))
    .retries(10)
    .fixed_backoff(Duration::from_millis(100))
    .await?;
```

Or exponential backoff, where the delay doubles each time, with a max delay of 1 second:

```rust
tryhard::retry_fn(|| read_file("Cargo.toml"))
    .retries(10)
    .exponential_backoff(Duration::from_millis(10))
    .max_delay(Duration::from_secs(1))
    .await?;
```

See [the docs](https://docs.rs/tryhard) for more details.
