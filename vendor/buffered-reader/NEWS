#+TITLE: buffered-reader NEWS â€“ history of user-visible changes
#+STARTUP: content hidestars

* Changes in 1.2.0
** Notable changes
   - BufferedReader::copy is like std::io::copy, but more efficient.
 * Notable fixes
   - A parser bug was fixed.  We classify this as a low-severity
     issue, because Rust correctly detects the out-of-bounds access
     and panics.  If an attacker controls the input, they may be able
     to use this bug to cause a denial of service.

     situations.
